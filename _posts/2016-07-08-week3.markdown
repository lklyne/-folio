Initial prototyping discussion
Create a game plan for the coming weeks

#### Sat/Sun
Continue secondary research



## Ideation synthesis and refinement
We narrowed down our ideas down from 160 to the top three we wanted to explore further. The three ideas below all have different levels of hardware and software engagment, relative to our problem space.

## Concept 1 - 411 BOT

An AI bot for vetting answers and sharing information via SMS

#### Target User & Problem
Rumors are a problem during disasters. So providing a direct source of information can help prevent panic, fear, or inaction. The 411 Bot provides local survivors with up to date, localized information, verified by individuals with direct access to answers.

#### How it Works
Individuals can text 411 Bot and ask questions. The system then strategically asks individuals to provide answers backed with evidence to come to a reliable answer. Additional developments to the question are also sent to participants as they occur. Questions that have already been answered are grouped with existing information.

## Concept 2 - SUPER HAM RADIO

A two-way communication device using smart phone and radio technology.

#### Target User & Problem
After a large scale disaster, communication infrastructure is frequently compromised. This problem is compounded by the fact that there is an increased need to communicate, meaning what remains of the communication infrastructure becomes overloaded. Local survivors need to communicate with each other to find resources, understand the situation, and organize. This device facilitates this communication between locals, especially those in organizational roles, when cell networks are down.

#### How it Works
A two way radio is augmented with hardware that can interface with a smartphone. The on-board hardware takes information from a smartphone, such as text, and converts it into a format that can be transmitted over radio. A nearby radio receives this information, decodes it, and displays or relays the message. The radio also has hardware to generate power, such as a solar panel or hand crank.

## Concept 3 - TRADER

Connecting people who need, with people who have.

#### Target User & Problem
This allows locals a real-time channel for resource sharing. Currently, there’s not a way to keep track of inventory for donations, which can lead to over donating, under donating, or donations that aren’t needed.

#### How it Works
This idea connects locals that are within a specific proximity, allowing them to share resources or supplies after a disaster. This app allows users to define their need or are willing to gift supplies. Once a donor is connected to someone who has requested supplies, the donor will deliver the supplies.

## Moving forward
We have some things to work out over the coming weeks.

-Connect the concepts to the research
-Understanding of similar types of volunteerism and donations during natural disasters
-Outline the specific scenarios for the solutions
-Make each storyboard reflect the specific problem we are trying to solve for
-Understand the technology required
-What does the technological degradation look like?
