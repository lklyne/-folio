## Second round of ideation 
We conducted a second phase of ideation focusing on generating wild, outside the box solutions as well as trying to ensure the worst possible outcome.

Design Prompts
- How can we help supply donors make sure their donations are needed and delivered?
- How can we help encourage and coordinate evacuation in urban areas after a natural disaster?
- How can we coordinate skilled work through volunteers after a natural disaster?
- How do you enable someone with a non-critical injury to get the help they need as quickly as possible?
- How can we help disaster survivors gain pertinent information about risks in the environment?
- How can we help disaster survivors quickly and efficiently clear rubble from their homes?
- How can we help disaster survivors quickly identify fact from rumors?

Worst Outcome Prompts
- How can we ensure supply donors give as many useless supplies to the wrong people?
- How can we convince urban dwellers to stay in their homes despite imminent danger?
- How can we dissuade skilled workers from volunteering their efforts to people in need?
- How can we make sure that someone with non-critical injury is put in more danger by amateur responders?
- How can we ensure that rumors are propagated, resulting in poor decision making and increased harm?
- How can we ensure that information does not get delivered to the people that need it?
- How do we allow and encourage people to profit from emergency situations?

## Concept presentation

After our second round of ideation, we had over 160 ideas.

We narrowed these down to our top 13 and created single page write-ups for each. For each concept, we created a brief description, overview of the interaction model, short storyboard documenting its use, the problem it solves / what it does differently than existing technology, and how it works from a technical standpoints. 

We presented these ideas in class, and had classmates provide feedback with stickies and verbally.

## Idea grouping and organization

We created a series of 2x2 matrices to help us better group and understand ideas.

We also cut out hero images for each of the 13 ideas to try out different groupings and mashups.
