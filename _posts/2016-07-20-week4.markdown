#### Target User & Problem
Rumors are a problem during disasters. So providing a direct source of information can help prevent panic, fear, or inaction. The 411 Bot provides local survivors with up to date, localized information, verified by individuals with direct access to answers.

#### How it Works
Individuals can text 411 Bot and ask questions. The system then strategically asks individuals to provide answers backed with evidence to come to a reliable answer. Additional developments to the question are also sent to participants as they occur. Questions that have already been answered are grouped with existing information.

## Moving forward
We have some things to work out over the coming weeks.

-Connect the concepts to the research<br/>
-Understanding of similar types of volunteerism and donations during natural disasters<br/>
-Outline the specific scenarios for the solutions<br/>
-Make each storyboard reflect the specific problem we are trying to solve for<br/>
-Understand the technology required<br/>
-What does the technological degradation look like?
