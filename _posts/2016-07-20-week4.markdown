## Schedule  

#### Monday
Attended class and went over our goals and milestones for the week

#### Tuesday
Created additional storyboards to define the scenarios of use that we want our design to support

#### Wednesday
Outlined possible prototypes and research questions we need answered

#### Thursday
Meeting with professors to update them on our progress
Team meeting, including our sponsor (Smart Technology) for project feedback

#### Friday
Creation of first paper prototype (camping trip)
Pilot tested the paper prototype with 4 people from Startup Hall

#### Sat/Sun
Discussion on different interaction models - group formation, information gathering


#### This weeks goal
To create a prototyping plan and start building the different prototyping activities. In doing this, we hope to understand the behavior and mindset of people, both in a group, and as an individual seeking information.

## Prototype 1 - Supply & Collaboration

#### Activity Summary + Protocol
A group-based planning and supply activity. A group of 4-6 people will be asked to coordinate a camping trip. In the pilot version of the activity, the group was asked to complete this task with one member acting as the group leader. The leader was given a short checklist and asked to document the planning process using pen and paper.

-Introduce all group members, frame the purpose of the activity and the common goal.<br/>
-Provide prompts to facilitate group discussion and group consensus.<br/>
-Ask participants to plan their camping trip via provided tools.<br/>
-De-brief with group about the overall experience.<br/>

The activity will be documented naturally, as the participants will create a group chat and document. At the end of the activity, key points from the de-brief will be recorded with notes. 

#### Research Question
How can we improve resource and information sharing within a local community?

#### Design Hypothesis
We expect that online collaborative tools can improve resources and information sharing that currently occurs more organically. 

#### Participant Observation

## Moving forward
Over the next week, we'll create additional prototypes to understand different aspects of the solution space. The two prototypes we are targeting are around privacy and how groups form. The findings from these three should be an appropriate starting point for our high fidelity mock-up.
