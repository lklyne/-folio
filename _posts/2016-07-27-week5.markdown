## Schedule  

#### Monday

#### Tuesday

#### Wednesday
Team consultation with the Safe Walk team  
  
In the team consultation both our team and Safe Walk shared and gave feedback on our prototyping plan. 
The Safe Walk team surprisingly had a similar direction of a location based social application. 
Part of the feedback we received was to consider if our design could belong to an existing social platform.
 Additionally, they had difficulty understanding how the design related back to our topic. 


#### Thursday

#### Friday

#### Sat/Sun
